### Setting Up the API Key

To use the `quickstart.ipynb`, you need to create a `.env` file to store your API key. Here's how to do it:

1. Visit [https://app.balldontlie.io/](https://app.balldontlie.io/) and create an account to obtain the EPL API.
2. In your project directory, create a new file named `.env`.
3. In the `.env` file, add the following line, replacing `'Replace with the key that you get from the website'` with your actual API key:

```bash
BALLDONTLIE_API_KEY = 'Replace with the key that you get from the website'
```
